    <!-- Introduction -->
    <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
    <purpose>
        <p>Before going into details of equivalence validation, it will be appropriate to discuss why equivalence validation of product data is required. All product model data are created by some CAD system and it is well known that created product data frequently travels two or more different IT systems to conduct expected applications in various types of design, simulation, manufacturing preparation, etc. For travelling from an IT system to other IT system, data conversion by the use of STEP translator, or other types of translators is required. As is well known, numerical representation method and satisfied precision are IT system dependent. Therefore, data conversion may cause slight difference of data. For users of the data, whether or not the difference of data caused by the conversion is acceptable for the applications expected to be conducted for the converted data is critically important, since it concerns with the reliability of the data. The check to validate whether or not the difference between the original data and the converted data is acceptable is “Equivalence Validation”. This part of ISO 10303 deals with this equivalence validation for product data.</p>
        <p>It shall be noted that the comparison for checking equivalence is not conducted for arbitrary selected two product data, but conducted for the two product data where one is obtained from the other by data conversion. Therefore, there is an assumption that the two product data are not very different but are similar from various points of view.</p>
        <p>There are various constituent data types of product data. In this edition of ISO 10303, shape data equivalence, assembly data equivalence, and PMI data equivalence are targets of equivalence validation. Equivalence of other constituents of product data will be dealt with in the future editions.</p>
        <p>This part of ISO 10303 consists of five mutually related schemas as shown in Figure 1. The first schema, namely the product data equivalence definition schema, defines high level data elements for managing product data equivalence information such as the relationship of the product data equivalence information with the pertaining product data inspected. The second schema, namely the product data equivalence criteria schema, deals with general product data and specifies how to represent equivalence criteria and equivalence inspection requirements. The third schema, namely the product data equivalence inspection result schema, also deals with general product data and specifies how to represent equivalence inspection results. Specifications defined in the second and the third schemas are sufficiently general so that equivalence of various types of product data other than shape data, assembly data and PMI data can be dealt with in the future.</p>
        <p>Two schemas, the annotated model 3d equivalence criteria schema and the annotated model 3d equivalence inspection result schema are specializations of the product data equivalence criteria schema and the product data equivalence inspection result schema respectively to annotated model 3d data. The equivalence of annotated model 3d data is further classified into Shape data equivalence, Assembly data equivalence, and PMI equivalence, that are standardized in detail in the annotated_model_3d_equivalence_shape_module, annotated_model_3d_equivalence_assembly module and annotated_model_3d_equivalence_PMI module respectively.</p>
        <p>The target product shape data representation is limited in this part of ISO 10303 to the data conforming to ISO 10303-42, and some APs based on ISO 10303-42. The target assembly data representation also is limited to ISO 10303 relevant representation though the treatment of leaf component part shape representation is similar to that of ISO 10303-242. The target PMI data presentation and representation is similar to ISO 10303-242.</p>
        <p>Each criterion for equivalence validation may include a pertaining inspection requirement. An inspection requirement provides a textual description of how the criterion is to be inspected and may have additional attributes and rules to control the test and the element or elements to be tested. It does not provide an algorithm for the inspection process. It is expected that the developer of a product data validation checking program will develop his algorithm for the inspection so that that algorithm satisfies the inspection requirement specified.</p>
        <note number="1"> Inspection algorithms are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303 since it is understood that algorithm development is a competitive arena for engineering system vendors and cannot be standardized by an international standard.</note>
        <p>For the assessment of equivalence validation by numerical test, thresholds which are user definable from application protocols supporting above described shape, assembly and PMI data representations, such as ISO 10303-242[1], play a key role. An example of a typical threshold is a distance threshold for validating the maximum deviation of the original and converted product data. That distance threshold implies that if the maximum distance between corresponding position of the two product data is greater than or equal to the specified minimum value, then the deviation shall be understood as unacceptable deviation. Appropriate thresholds depend on many factors such as size of a product, design requirements, sensitivity of engineering systems to numerical imprecision, etc. Therefore, what threshold value to use needs to be carefully determined in each business situation based on agreement among business partners.</p>
        <p>The product data equivalence inspection result schema provides representation of equivalence inspection results for two specified product data with regard to specified equivalence criteria. The inspection result indicates whether or not the two product data inspected contain unacceptable difference. It may also include detailed information on what type of unacceptable difference is existing, and how serious the difference is, together with the product data element where the problem is detected. This information is expected to be useful for the equivalence improvement process.</p>
        <p>Figure I.1 denotes the model structure of five schemas and the relationship with the target product data. Figure I.2 denotes more detailed relationship of top three schemas, that are product_data_equivalence_definition schema, product_data_equivalence_criteria schema, and product_data_equivalence_inspection_result schema. Together with five schemas in this standard, six modules are constituents of equivalence validation standards, that are ;</p>

            <b>5.2.1    Representation of product data equivalence criteria</b>
            <p>Product data equivalence can be unambiguously represented by a combination of equivalence criteria. Each criterion may have one or more associated inspection requirement and assessment specification.</p>
            <p>It is anticipated that there are equivalence criteria of which inspection requirement is not possible to clearly specify. For this reason, this schema provides both equivalence criteria with or without relationship to pertaining inspection requirement.</p>
            <example number="1">‘implied semantics shall be completely converted’ is a clear and important product data equivalence requirement. In this case, ‘identical implied semantics’ will become a criterion. Therefore, satisfaction of the criterion implies existence of equivalence defect. But, unambiguous specification of identical implied semantics will be quite difficult to define.</example>
            <example number="2">Significant deviation between corresponding positions of the two product data will be problematic for receiver side since it will deteriorate reliability of the data. In order to detect this type of non-equivalent data, the criterion ‘

                <b>annotated_model_3d_equivalence_shape_module</b> is prepared. In order to judge the equivalence, related inspection shall be based on the calculation of distance between two corresponding surfaces. The distance shall be calculated ideally for any point on a surface as minimum distance to the corresponding surface. After calculating this distance for all points on the surface, maximum value among them shall be obtained. Then this maximum distance shall be compared with the threshold defined for this criterion for evaluating if non-equivalent defect is existing or not. This example shows combination of quality criterion, associated inspection requirement and assessment specification form core part of equivalence validation model representation.

            <p>Equivalence requirement is application dependent and target design requirement dependent. This schema allows users to select a set of necessary criteria from the standardized criteria and combine them to represent his requirements on product data equivalence.</p>
            <p>Specifications in this schema are enough general so that they can be applied for equivalence of any property of a product data. Specialization of this schema to annotated model 3d data is given in clause 7. Specialization to product data equivalence of any property other than annotated model 3d data will also be possible in the future as a specialization of this schema.</p>
            <b>5.2.2    Correspondence of data elements to compare</b>
            <p>Correspondence of data elements to compare, one in the original product model, the other in the converted model shall be exactly known. As for shape model, external specification of correspondence finding algorithm is given in the <b>annotated_model_3d_shape_equivalence</b> module.</p>
            <p>As for assembly model and PMI data, it is understood that there is no commonly used method for detecting the correspondence, but the use of user given name when applicable, or bounding box for knowing spatial extent, etc. are used. In the definition of criteria in <b>annotated_model_3d_equivalence_assembly</b> module and <b>annotated_model_3d_equivalence_PMI</b> module, it is assumed that the correspondence is known outside of those standards. If unique naming method such as UUID is developed in the future, it is assumed that unique name will be transferred via STEP translator.</p>
            <b>5.2.3    Representation of the requirement on inspection of product data quivalence</b>
            <p>In order to inspect if a non-equivalent defect is existing or not, reliable inspection shall be associated to each equivalence criterion.</p>
            <p>The following are requirements for reliable inspection:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Appropriate data element shall be inspected.</li>
                <li>Necessary conditions for appropriate inspection shall be clarified such as mandatory inspection process if definable, what physical quantity shall be inspected, what special cases shall be taken into account, required precision of inspection result, etc.</li>
                <li>Robust algorithm that satisfies all the requirements represented by 1. above shall be deployed.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It is understood that inspection algorithm belongs to competitive arena for engineering system vendors and therefore shall not be standardized by an International Standard. By this reason, requirement 3. above is outside the scope of this standard.</p>
            <p>The representation of inspection requirement is designed so that it can be used both for equivalence criteria representation and inspection result representation.</p>

                <b>summary_equivalence_report_request</b> is recommended to capture overall equivalence level such as how many entities were checked regarding the criterion and how many entities among them were judged as having non-equivalent defect. The use of                 
                <b>detailed_equivalence_report_request</b> is suited to obtain more detailed report such as what entity instance caused non-equivalent defect and how serious it is. It has attributes to request a report on all the inspected elements or only on elements with non-equivalent defect. Expected number of elements to be reported and expected sequence of report may also be specified.

It does not directly define what is good equivalence data but rather classifies and enumerates equivalence concerns for detecting non-equivalent data. This schema is a specialization of

Therefore, all the fundamental concepts and assumptions described in 5.2 also apply. This schema provides classified annotated model 3d criteria together with pertaining inspection requirements and thresholds for the assessment of annotated model 3d equivalence. Accuracy is also related to each criterion when appropriate.

            <b>7.2.1    Representation of the criteria of annotated model 3d equivalence and its classification</b>
            <p>The equivalence of annotated model 3d data is modelled in this part of ISO 10303 by classifying them into shape data equivalence, assembly data equivalence and PMI data equivalence. Practical inconveniences which may cause rework in receiver side in order to improve received data usable in receiver’s job. These inconveniences mainly arise due to inappropriate numerical representation or inappropriate numerical manipulation of underlying mathematical model. These inconveniences are highly CAD system dependent. The classification is based on taxonomy of known problems caused by non-equivalent annotated model 3d data.</p>
            <note number="1">It is understood that good equivalence annotated model 3d data represent design result entirely with acceptable precision where degree of satisfaction of design requirements and design intent is explicitly represented. Though use of 3D engineering systems is expanding, no system fully supports creation and maintenance of good equivalence annotated model 3d data as defined above. Satisfaction of the requirement ‘degree of satisfaction of design requirements and design intent is explicitly represented’ is still a big unresolved research issue.</note>
            <note number="2">Shape data of the concerned annotated model 3d data shall be represented using entities defined in ISO 10303-42 or entities defined in AP based on ISO 10303-42.

            <p>Aesthetic quality of product shape is a decisive factor for some type of product such as passenger car.

            <p>It may not be practical to obtain detailed information of inspection results of annotated model 3d equivalence entirely and send them to later stages.

            <p>Each criterion has an associated inspection requirement. An inspection requirement provides a textual description of how the criterion is to be inspected and may have additional attributes and rules to control the test and the element or elements to be tested. It does not provide an algorithm for the inspection process. It may be said that an inspection requirement plays a role of external specification for reliable inspection algorithm.</p>

                <b>thresholds</b> which are user definable from AP (Application Protocol) play a key role. An example of a typical threshold is a distance threshold for evaluating a deviation between corresponding positions of the two product data inspected. That distance threshold implies that maximum distance between the two corresponding arc-wise connected surfaces shall be smaller than the threshold. Appropriate thresholds depend on many factors such as size of a product, design requirements, robustness of engineering systems on numerical precision, etc. Therefore, what threshold value to use shall be carefully determined in each business situation based on agreement among business partners.

            <b>7.2.4    Representation of required accuracy for annotated model 3d data equivalence inspection</b>
            <p>In most cases, especially when free form geometry is involved, the inspection algorithm calculates an approximate solution not an exact solution. In the above example, arc-wise connected surfaces consist of an infinite number of points. Since calculation on an infinite number of points is impossible, any algorithm tries to calculate the solution using a sufficient number of finite points. In order to require the difference of the approximate solution and the exact solution, even when it is unknown, smaller than the expected value, accuracy specification is provided. The accuracy shall be understood that an approximate solution is acceptable if the difference of the approximate solution and other approximate solution obtained by calculation with any other finer sampling points is smaller than the given accuracy. There are two types of accuracies, one is general accuracy applied to all the inspections and the other is specific accuracy applied only to specified inspection.</p>

            <p>Users will specify thresholds to judge if a criterion is satisfied or not, which depends on business situation. They may or may not specify the accuracy for controlling precision of numerical calculation used in the inspection. But there are many cases that the information on the accuracy that is actually applied by the inspection is useful to interpret an inspection result. For this purpose, representation of the common accuracy applied to every inspection as well as the accuracy applied to inspection of specific criterion are provided in this schema.</p>
