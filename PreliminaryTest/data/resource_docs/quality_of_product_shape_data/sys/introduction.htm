      <p>
         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
         representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
         The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
         products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only
         for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and
         sharing product databases, and as a basis 
         for retention and archiving.
         
      </p>
      <p> Major subdivisions of this part of ISO 10303 are:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>product_data_quality_definition_schema;</li>
         <li>product_data_quality_criteria_schema;</li>
         <li>product_data_quality_inspection_result_schema;</li>
         <li>shape_data_quality_criteria_schema;</li>
         <li>shape_data_quality_inspection_result_schema.</li>
      </ul>
         
      <p>
         Before going into details of the quality of product data, it will be useful to note that quality of product 
         (physical object), quality of product model, and quality of product model data are different concepts. 
         With reference to the definition of the term &#8216;quality&#8217; in ISO 9000, we define the term &#8216;quality of product&#8217; 
         as &#8216;a measure of degree of satisfaction of requirements of a product on appearance, functionality and performance&#8217;. 
         The conceptual product model is adequately defined in ISO 10303 but there is currently very little provision for 
         the specification of quality of product model. 
         Only tolerance information associated to a product model may be categorized as the information concerning 
         quality of product model. Product model data is a representation of a (conceptual) product model with a 
         finite number of digits. It naturally includes numerical precision problems. 
         Slight inconsistencies amongst geometric entities, topological entities and between geometry and topology 
         may be inappropriate for some applications. 
         All product model data are created by some CAD system and it is well known that the numerical representation 
         method and precision obtained are CAD system dependent. 
         This part of ISO 10303 deals with the erroneous or inappropriate characteristics of product model data. 
         
      </p>
       
      <p>
         Other ISO standards that have provisions on the quality of products, including specification, 
         verification and process for improvements, have no information on the quality of product data. 
         Product data quality related specification in ISO 10303 is at present restricted to the overall numerical 
         precision of an entire product model. 
         Provision of more detailed specifications for the representation of the quality of product data, 
         especially that of three dimensional shape data, will promote quality guaranteed (assured) data exchange 
         and will reduce unnecessary rework to adjust the transferred product data to a usable state in the receiving system.
          
      </p>
       
      <p>
         This part of ISO 10303 consists of five mutually related schemas as shown in Figure E.2 in Annex E. 
         The first schema, namely the product data quality definition schema, defines high level data elements for 
         managing product data quality information such as the relationship of the product data quality information 
         with the product data inspected. 
         
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p>
         The second schema, namely the product data quality criteria schema, deals with general product data 
         and specifies how to represent quality criteria and quality measurement requirements. 
         The third schema, namely the product data quality inspection result schema, also deals with general product 
         data and specifies how to represent quality inspection results. 
         Specifications defined in the second and the third schemas are sufficiently general so that quality of 
         various types of product data other than shape data can be dealt with in the future.
         This edition includes a technical revision of the first edition in order to cope with non-geometric data 
         quality issues. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p class="note"><small><a name="note_1">NOTE&nbsp;1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            
            Standards for dealing with non-geometric data quality issues are 'externally conditioned data quality'
            modules which are specializations of the second and the third schemas.
            
            </small></p>
       
      <p>
         Two schemas, the shape data quality criteria schema and the shape data quality inspection result schema 
         are specializations of the product data quality criteria schema and the product data quality inspection 
         result schema respectively to shape data. 
         The quality of product shape data is modelled in this part of ISO 10303 by classifying practical inconveniences 
         including erroneous data, inappropriate data or other items that hinder successful data exchange. 
         These mainly arise due to inappropriate numerical representation of the underlying mathematical model. 
         The classification is based on the taxonomy of known problems caused by low quality product shape data. 
         Major classifications are &#8216;erroneous data&#8217; and &#8216;inapt data&#8217;. 
         Problems are further categorized as geometry issues, topology issues, combined geometry /topology issues and 
         geometric model issues. 
          
      </p>
       
      <p>
         The target product shape data representation is limited in this part of ISO 10303 to the data conforming to 
         ISO 10303-42 although it may be enhanced to allow other representations including native CAD data in future editions. 
         
      </p>
       
      <p>
         Each criterion includes a corresponding measurement requirement. 
         A measurement requirement provides a textual description of how the criterion is to be measured and may 
         have additional attributes and rules to control the test and the element or elements to be tested. 
         It does not provide an algorithm for the measurement process. 
         It is expected that the developer of a product data quality checking program will develop his algorithm for 
         the measurement so that that algorithm satisfies the measurement requirement specified.
         
      </p>
      
      <p class="note"><small><a name="note_2">NOTE&nbsp;2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
              
            Measurement algorithms are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303 since it is understood that 
            algorithm development is a competitive arena for engineering system vendors and cannot be standardized 
            by an international standard.
            </small></p>
      
      <p>
         For the assessment of shape data quality by numerical test, thresholds, which are user definable from application 
         protocols supporting shape models, play a key role. 
         Enhancement of the existing Application Protocols, such as ISO 10303-203[2] and ISO 10303-214[3], 
         to support shape data quality information, or development of new Application Protocols which treat shape data 
         quality will be eased by the use of the procedure suggested in [5]. 
         An example of a typical threshold is a distance threshold for evaluating a gap between a base surface and 
         bounding curves for trimming the effective portion of the surface. 
         That distance threshold implies that if the maximum distance between the surface and the curves is 
         greater than or equal to the specified minimum value, then the gap shall be understood as a quality defect. 
         Appropriate thresholds depend on many factors such as size of a product, design requirements, 
         sensitivity of engineering systems to numerical imprecision, etc. 
         Therefore, what threshold value to use needs to be carefully determined in each business situation 
         based on agreement among business partners.
         
      </p>
       
      <p>
         The shape data quality inspection result schema provides representation of quality inspection results 
         for a specific product shape data with regard to specified quality criteria. 
         The inspection result indicates whether, or not, the product shape data inspected contains quality defects. 
         It may also include detailed information on what type of quality defect is existing, and how serious 
         the defect is, together with the shape element data where the problem is detected. 
         This information is expected to be useful for the quality healing process and to help efficient 
         co-operation between the quality checking process and the healing process of the product shape data.
         
      </p>
      
      <p class="note"><small><a name="note_3">NOTE&nbsp;3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            
            Numbers enclosed in triangles in Figure E.2 denote internal references within the figure. 
            This is not standard EXPRESS-G style but is used to prevent complicated long path references. 
            Similar notation is also used in Figures E.3, E.4 and E.5. 
            </small></p>
      
      The selection of instantiated data elements from those shown in Figure E.2 depends upon the scenario of quality 
      information usage. Amongst the expected scenarios for the use of this part of ISO 10303 are:
      
      <dl>
         
         <dt><b>Requirement of quality:</b></dt>
         
         <dd>
            The ordering company may require the company receiving the order to create product data that satisfies 
            prescribed quality requirements. 
            Examples are exclusion of infinitesimal geometry smaller than the given tolerance, exclusion of redundant 
            geometry not contributing to the representation of product shape, etc. 
            Very limited information, namely relevant criteria together with required thresholds from those in Figure E.2,
            is necessary in this scenario. 
            The information may be transferred together with the ordering sheet.
            
         </dd>
         
         <dt><b>Declaration of quality:</b></dt>
         
         <dd> 
            The creator of a product data may use quality information for explicitly declaring the quality level 
            satisfied by his/her model. 
            Depending on the design method and the CAD system used, the quality of the product data may be unambiguously 
            declared without any inspection. 
            Selective criteria and thresholds for which the model is judged to be quality defect free are required 
            information in this scenario. 
            The quality information may be transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
            
         </dd>
         
         <dt><b>Assurance of quality:</b></dt>
         
         <dd> 
            A quality assurance organization may use quality information for representing the results of quality inspection 
            for a particular product model data. 
            This scenario will require inspected quality criteria together with thresholds used, 
            measurement requirements deployed and inspection results obtained. 
            The accuracies used may also be included. 
            The information is transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
            
         </dd>
         
         <dt><b>Quality information for use in quality improvement:</b></dt>
         
         <dd> 
            If a quality defect is detected by quality inspection, necessary actions for improving 
            critical data will be required. 
            For that purpose, information on the nature and severity of any quality defects should be provided. 
            Therefore, this scenario will require a detailed inspection result report at the geometric entity instance level. 
            This information is transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
            
         </dd>
         
         <dt><b>Long term archival of product data:</b></dt>
         
         <dd> 
             It is desirable that a detailed record of product model data quality is archived with product data. 
             The data requirement for this purpose is similar to that needed for assurance of quality.
            
         </dd>
         
      </dl>
      
      <p>

      Constituent schemas of this part of ISO 10303 are as follows:
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            <b>Product_data_quality_definition schema:</b> defines high level data elements for managing product 
            data quality information;
            
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Product_data_quality_criteria schema:</b> provides general specifications for the representation of 
            quality criteria, quality measurement requirements and quality assessment specifications for product data;
            
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Product_data_quality_inspection_result schema:</b> provides general specifications for the 
            representation of quality inspection results for a particular product data;
            
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Shape_data_quality_criteria schema:</b> provides representations of shape data quality criteria 
            together with corresponding measurement requirements, thresholds for judging the existence or absence of 
            quality defects and assessment specifications for product shape data;
            
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Shape_data_quality_inspection_result schema:</b> provides representations of quality inspection 
            results for a particular product shape data with regard to specified quality criteria. 
            Detailed information on what type of quality defect is existing, and how serious the defect is, 
            together with the shape element data where the problem is detected can also be represented;
