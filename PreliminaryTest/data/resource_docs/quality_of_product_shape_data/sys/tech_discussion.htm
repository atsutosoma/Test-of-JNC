       <b><i>E.1  Background</i></b>
      
      <p>
         Increase of the use of engineering systems (CAD/CAM/CAE/CG systems) in product development has 
         revealed the significance of product data quality (PDQ) as a key issue for realizing successful 
         collaborative product development based on product data.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         A NIST report titled &#8220;Economic Impact Assessment of the International Standard for the Exchange of 
         Product Model Data (STEP) in Transportation Industries&#8221;[6] estimates that one billion dollars per 
         year saving will be realized by full use of STEP in US transportation industries (Aerospace, Automotive, 
         Shipbuilding). 
         Improvement of PDQ that eliminates rework could realize further cost savings.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Namely, establishment of widely acceptable methodology for guaranteeing appropriate quality of product 
         model data is critically important for drastically raising effectiveness of the use of 3D engineering 
         systems and for decreasing economic loss.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         SASIG&#8217;s initiative to develop the automotive PDQ guidelines is a major response to this critical issue. 
         However, PDQ issues are not specific to the automotive industry, but are common to all manufacturing industries. 
         PDQ criteria and acceptable values may differ from one industry to another, and this part of ISO 10303 is 
         intended to allow for such differences.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Additionally, standardization of PDQ methodology is expected to encourage IT vendors to develop better 
         systems in view of product data quality.
         
      </p>
      
       <b><i>E.2  Definition of product data quality</i></b>
      
      <p>
         Although importance of product data quality has been widely recognized, it is not yet clearly defined 
         what &#8220;product data quality&#8221; is. 
         In the discussion of &#8220;product data quality&#8221;, we have to distinguish quality of &#8220;product data&#8221; from that 
         of &#8220;product&#8221; itself and &#8220;product model&#8221;, because these three types of qualities are often mixed up in 
         conventional context.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         &#8220;Product&#8221; is a manufactured physical body, and &#8220;product model&#8221; is a mathematical model to 
         represent &#8220;product&#8221; on computers. 
         &#8220;Product data&#8221; is numerical data that represent product information in accordance with &#8220;product model.&#8221;
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         &#8220;Product quality&#8221; is defined as the degree of satisfaction of users&#8217; requirements on its function, 
         performance, appearance and so on. 
         There are a number of existing researches and achievements on &#8220;product quality.&#8221; 
         We also have the standard &#8220;ISO 9000&#8221; for the management of &#8220;product quality.&#8221;
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         On the other hand, we don&#8217;t even have a basic definition of &#8220;product model quality.&#8221;
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Since &#8220;product data&#8221; is based on &#8220;product model&#8221;, it is difficult to give rigorous or theoretical 
         definition of &#8220;product data quality&#8221; today.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         This is the reason why we adopt in this standard a practical approach described below for modelling 
         &#8220;product data quality.&#8221;
         
      </p>
       <br><br><a name="figure_E.1"></a><div align="center"><IMG src="../fig-e.1.gif" border="0" alt="Figure E.1&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality of product, product model and product data"></div><br><div align="center"><b>Figure E.1&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality of product, product model and product data</b></div><br>
      
      <p>
         Issues that hinder successful exchange or sharing of product data have been categorized as either erroneous data or inapt
         data. Each of these classes has been further categorized into the subclasses of geometry-specific issues, topology-specific
         issues, combined geometry and topology issues and geometric modelling issues. These are further discussed in clause E.4.
         
      </p>
      
       <b><i>E.3  Target data type of PDQ-S</i></b>
      
      <p>
         Among variety of information consisting of product data, we concentrate on three dimensional shape data 
         in this standard though schemas for allowing future extension to cope with non-shape data 
         quality are also included. 
         The reason why we concentrate on three dimensional shape data is that it is the core information and most 
         repair work is done to improve shape data today. 
         Reflecting our focus, this project is called &#8220;PDQ-S.&#8221; (Product Data Quality &#8211; Shape)
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         There are various ways to represent three dimensional product shape, B-rep, CSG and parametric 
         feature based representation. 
         Among them, we concentrate on parametric curves and surfaces, and B-rep data, because these data are 
         majority of 3D shape data transferred and shared today.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Although use of parametrically represented 3D shape data in explicit form with geometric constraints, 
         implicit form with construction history, or with their mixture are increasing especially in solid 
         modelling environment, it will take some time to enable parametric data exchange since some of 
         the related standards in ISO 10303 have reached to IS level very recently. 
         Therefore, we will leave quality of shape data with parametric information as a future issue.
         
      </p>
       <b><i>E.4  Quality criteria of three-dimensional shape data</i></b> 
      
      <p>
         Quality criteria of three-dimensional shape data are classified into the following classes:
         
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Erroneous data;</li>
         
         <li>Inapt data;</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>
         Each of these classes is further categorized into the following sub-classes:
         
      </p>
      <ul>
         
         <li>Geometry specific issue;</li>
         
         <li>Topology specific issue;</li>
         
         <li>Combined geometry and topology issue;</li>
         
         <li>Geometric model issues.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>
         &#8216;Erroneous data&#8217; implies mathematically invalid product shape data. 
         Amongst examples are erroneous b_spline surface definition, open edge loop and inconsistent face and 
         underlying surface normals.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         &#8216;Inapt data&#8217; implies data inappropriate for applications though it may not be mathematically incorrect. 
         Amongst examples are self-intersecting curve, non-manifold at edge, narrow width surface patch and 
         gap between bounding edge and underlying surface.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Even when shape data have acceptable quality in the senses described above, there exists a number of 
         cases where engineers in downstream processes have to rework on the data.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         For example, mould design engineers have to modify a product shape data if appropriate draft angle is not 
         taken into account in the data. 
         Just knowing the fact whether various manufacturing requirements are incorporated into the data or not 
         may save the cost of rework. 
         Therefore, these issues are within the scope of this project because they hinder circulation of product 
         data from up stream to down stream.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Unfortunately we cannot focus on them in this initial version because the information to be incorporated 
         is not yet well formalized. 
         But it&#8217;s among one of the most important open issues for this project.
         
      </p>
      
       <b><i>E.5  Thresholds and Accuracies</i></b>
      
      <p>
         For the assessment of shape data quality by numerical test, thresholds which are user definable from 
         AP (Application Protocol) play a key role. 
         An example of a typical threshold is a distance threshold for evaluating a gap between a base surface 
         and bounding curves for trimming the effective portion of the surface. 
         That distance threshold implies that maximum distance between the surface and the curves shall 
         be smaller than the threshold. 
         Appropriate thresholds depend on many factors such as size of a product, design requirements, 
         robustness of engineering systems on numerical precision, etc. 
         Therefore, what threshold value to use shall be carefully determined in each business situation based 
         on agreement among business partners.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         In most cases, especially when free form geometry is involved, the measurement algorithm calculates an 
         approximate solution not an exact solution. 
         In the above example, surface and curves consist of an infinite number of points. 
         Since calculation on an infinite number of points is impossible, any algorithm tries to calculate 
         the solution using a sufficient number of finite points. 
         In order to require the difference of the approximate solution and the exact solution, even when 
         it is unknown, smaller than the expected value, accuracy specification is provided. 
         The accuracy shall be understood that an approximate solution is acceptable if the difference of the 
         approximate solution and other approximate solution obtained by calculation with any other 
         finer sampling points is smaller than the given accuracy. 
         There are two types of accuracies, one is general accuracy applied to all the measurements and the 
         other is specific accuracy applied only to specified measurement. 
         
      </p>
      
       <b><i>E.6  Assumptions on representation of product data</i></b>
      
      <p>
         The following two assumptions are rather reluctantly adopted in this standard.
         
      </p>
      
      <ol type="1">
         
         <li>Inspection target product data is limited to those conformant with ISO 10303.</li>
         
         <li>Quality data is assumed to be stored in the same STEP file as the inspection target product data</li>
         
      </ol>
      
      
      <p>
         It is clearly understood that product data quality is a common issue for all the product data representations. 
         The reason why assumption-1 is adopted is that consistency of PDQ data and inspection target product data , 
         such as consistency of representation context, is only guaranteed if the inspection target product data 
         is conformant with ISO 10303. 
         If this consistency issue is resolved, then the usability of this standard will be easily extended to 
         other product data representations.

         As already described, it is understood that PDQ data is not a constituent of product data. 
         It implies that PDQ data may or may not be stored together with the inspection target product data. 
         The reason why assumption-2 is adopted is that no methodology currently exists within SC4 to refer to 
         entity instance in externally defined product data file. 
         If entity instance reference mechanism to external file is provided then this limitation will be 
         immediately removed and PDQ data and the inspection target product data could become represented in 
         separate files with necessary relationship on condition that the entity instance reference mechanism to 
         external file does not require the change of quality model information structure.

       <b><i>E.7  Scenarios for the use of this standard</i></b>
      
      <p>
         The following subsections define data elements from
          
         to be instantiated for different usage scenarios involving quality information concerning product data. 
         For each case, the associated figure in this annex is a modified version of Figure E.2 retaining only 
         required data elements.

       <b><i>E.7.1  Requirement and Declaration of data quality </i></b>
      
      <p>
         Ordering company may require ordered company to create a product data so that it satisfies 
         prescribed quality requirements. 
         Examples are not to include infinitesimal geometry smaller than the given tolerance, 
         exclusion of redundant geometry not contributing to the representation of product shape, etc. 
         Very limited information, namely relevant criteria together with required thresholds from those in Figure E.2, 
         is necessary in this scenario. 
         The information may be transferred together with the ordering sheet.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The creator of a product data may use quality information for explicitly declaring the quality level 
         satisfied by his/her model. 
         Depending on the design method and the CAD system used, the quality of the product data may be 
         unambiguously declared without any inspection. 
         Selective criteria and thresholds for which the model is judged to be quality defect free are required 
         information in this scenario. 
         The quality information may be transferred together with the corresponding product model data.

       <br><br><a name="figure_E.3"></a><div align="center"><IMG src="../fig-e.3.gif" border="0" alt="Figure E.3&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality information for use in requirement/declaration of data quality"></div><br><div align="center"><b>Figure E.3&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality information for use in requirement/declaration of data quality</b></div><br>
      
       <b><i>E.7.1.2  Assurance of data quality, and long term data archiving</i></b>
      
      <p>
         A quality assurance organization may use quality information for representing the results of quality inspection 
         for a particular product model data. 
         This scenario will require inspected quality criteria together with thresholds used, 
         measurement requirements deployed and inspection results obtained. The accuracies used may also be included. 
         The information is transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         It is desirable that a detailed record of product model data quality is archived with product data. The
         data requirement for this purpose is similar to that needed for assurance of quality.
         
      </p>
      
       <br><br><a name="figure_E.4"></a><div align="center"><IMG src="../fig-e.4.gif" border="0" alt="Figure E.4&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality information for use in assurance of data quality"></div><br><div align="center"><b>Figure E.4&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality information for use in assurance of data quality</b></div><br>
      
       <b><i>E.7.1.3  Data quality information for use in quality improvement</i></b>
      
      <p>
         If a quality defect is detected by quality inspection, necessary actions for improving critical data will be 
         required. 
         For that purpose, information on the nature and severity of any quality defects should be provided. 
         Therefore, this scenario will require a detailed inspection result report at the geometric entity instance level. 
         This information is transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
