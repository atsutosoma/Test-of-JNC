      <p>
         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
         representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
         The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
         products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only
         for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and
         sharing product databases, and as a basis 
         for retention and archiving.
         
      </p>
      <p> Major subdivisions of this part of ISO 10303 are:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>product_data_equivalence_definition_schema;</li>
         <li>product_data_equivalence_criteria_schema;</li>
         <li>product_data_equivalence_inspection_result_schema;</li>
         <li>annotated_model_3d_equivalence_criteria_schema;</li>
         <li>annotated_model_3d_equivalence_inspection_result_schema.</li>
      </ul>
              
      <p>Before going into details of equivalence validation, it will be appropriate to discuss why equivalence validation of product
         data is required. All product model data are created by some CAD system and it is well known that created product data frequently
         travels two or more different IT systems to conduct expected applications in various types of design, simulation, manufacturing
         preparation, etc. For travelling from an IT system to other IT system, data conversion by the use of STEP translator, or other
         types of translators is required. As is well known, numerical representation method and satisfied precision are IT system
         dependent. Therefore, data conversion may cause slight difference of data. For users of the data, whether or not the difference
         of data caused by the conversion is acceptable for the applications expected to be conducted for the converted data is critically
         important, since it concerns with the reliability of the data. The check to validate whether or not the difference between
         the original data and the converted data is acceptable is &#8220;Equivalence Validation&#8221;. This part of ISO 10303 deals with this
         equivalence validation for product data.
      </p>
              
      <p>It shall be noted that the comparison for checking equivalence is not conducted for arbitrary selected two product data, but
         conducted for the two product data where one is obtained from the other by data conversion. Therefore, there is an assumption
         that the two product data are not very different but are similar from various points of view.
      </p>
              
      <p>There are various constituent data types of product data. In this edition of ISO 10303, shape data equivalence, assembly data
         equivalence, and PMI data equivalence are targets of equivalence validation. Equivalence of other constituents of product
         data will be dealt with in the future editions.
      </p>
              
      <p>This part of ISO 10303 consists of five mutually related schemas as shown in Figure 1. The first schema, namely the product
         data equivalence definition schema, defines high level data elements for managing product data equivalence information such
         as the relationship of the product data equivalence information with the pertaining product data inspected. The second schema,
         namely the product data equivalence criteria schema, deals with general product data and specifies how to represent equivalence
         criteria and equivalence inspection requirements. The third schema, namely the product data equivalence inspection result
         schema, also deals with general product data and specifies how to represent equivalence inspection results. Specifications
         defined in the second and the third schemas are sufficiently general so that equivalence of various types of product data
         other than shape data, assembly data and PMI data can be dealt with in the future.
      </p>
              
      <p>Two schemas, the annotated model 3d equivalence criteria schema and the annotated model 3d equivalence inspection result schema
         are specializations of the product data equivalence criteria schema and the product data equivalence inspection result schema
         respectively to annotated model 3d data. The equivalence of annotated model 3d data is further classified into Shape data
         equivalence, Assembly data equivalence, and PMI equivalence, that are standardized in detail in the annotated_model_3d_equivalence_shape_module,
         annotated_model_3d_equivalence_assembly module and annotated_model_3d_equivalence_PMI module respectively.
      </p>
              
      <p>The target product shape data representation is limited in this part of ISO 10303 to the data conforming to ISO 10303-42,
         and some APs based on ISO 10303-42. The target assembly data representation also is limited to ISO 10303 relevant representation
         though the treatment of leaf component part shape representation is similar to that of ISO 10303-242. The target PMI data
         presentation and representation is similar to ISO 10303-242.
      </p>
              
      <p>Each criterion for equivalence validation may include a pertaining inspection requirement. An inspection requirement provides
         a textual description of how the criterion is to be inspected and may have additional attributes and rules to control the
         test and the element or elements to be tested. It does not provide an algorithm for the inspection process. It is expected
         that the developer of a product data validation checking program will develop his algorithm for the inspection so that that
         algorithm satisfies the inspection requirement specified.
      </p>
              
      <p class="note"><small><a name="note_1">NOTE&nbsp;1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
             Inspection algorithms are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303 since it is understood that algorithm development is
            a competitive arena for engineering system vendors and cannot be standardized by an international standard.</small></p>
              
      <p>For the assessment of equivalence validation by numerical test, thresholds which are user definable from application protocols
         supporting above described shape, assembly and PMI data representations, such as ISO 10303-242[1], play a key role. An example
         of a typical threshold is a distance threshold for validating the maximum deviation of the original and converted product
         data. That distance threshold implies that if the maximum distance between corresponding position of the two product data
         is greater than or equal to the specified minimum value, then the deviation shall be understood as unacceptable deviation.
         Appropriate thresholds depend on many factors such as size of a product, design requirements, sensitivity of engineering systems
         to numerical imprecision, etc. Therefore, what threshold value to use needs to be carefully determined in each business situation
         based on agreement among business partners.
      </p>
              
      <p>The product data equivalence inspection result schema provides representation of equivalence inspection results for two specified
         product data with regard to specified equivalence criteria. The inspection result indicates whether or not the two product
         data inspected contain unacceptable difference. It may also include detailed information on what type of unacceptable difference
         is existing, and how serious the difference is, together with the product data element where the problem is detected. This
         information is expected to be useful for the equivalence improvement process.
      </p>
              
      <p>Figure I.1 denotes the model structure of five schemas and the relationship with the target product data. Figure I.2 denotes
         more detailed relationship of top three schemas, that are product_data_equivalence_definition schema, product_data_equivalence_criteria
         schema, and product_data_equivalence_inspection_result schema. Together with five schemas in this standard, six modules are
         constituents of equivalence validation standards, that are ;
